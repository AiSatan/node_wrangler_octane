# node_wrangler_octane
This is the same node_wrangler like in your blender, but with little changes to support octane shaders instead of blenders.

Some of the features so far..:

- viewer node / cntrl+shft+click on any node to add viewer node
- full transform&uwp projectile / ctrl+t
- switch-type-to / shift+s
- //working on texture setup for octane shaders / ctrl+shift+t
- //working on lazy mix / ctrl+shift+rmb

this plugin behave as octane one __only if your renderer set to octane__, you can change renderer to eevee/cycle to work as default one.

Be free to leave any feedback or feature request.

This plugin still can be used with cycle/eevee, it doesn't override any of default methods.
