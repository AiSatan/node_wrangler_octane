# node_wrangler_octane

**Please use this link to get the latest stable build https://github.com/AiSatan/node_wrangler_octane/releases and follow the instructions, thanks!**

This is the same node_wrangler like in your blender, but with little changes to support octane shaders instead of blenders.

Features so far..:

- viewer node / cntrl+shft+click on any node to add viewer node
- full transform&uwp projectile / select texture node and ctrl+t
- switch-type-to / select node and shift+s
- shader's texture setup for octane / ctrl+shift+t on shader node - https://youtu.be/SON0bUczSf0
- mix shader/textures with hotkeys / ctrl+shift+rmb / ctrl+numpad 0/ etc..

this plugin behave as octane one __only if your renderer set to octane__, you can change renderer to eevee/cycle to work as default one.

Be free to leave any feedback or feature request.

This plugin still can be used with cycle/eevee, it doesn't override any of default methods.
