# node_wrangler_octane
This is the same node_wrangler like in your blender, but with little changes so viewer node support octane shader.

this plugin only change viwer node in shader node and only if your renderer set to octane, use it as usual: 
cntrl+shft+click in node to view current node. 
Don't expect more.

it will add octane mat instead of cycle one, if you use octane, and will work as usual if you use cycle.

# Installation

Install just like any other plugin.

# Support
